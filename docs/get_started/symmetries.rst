Symmetries and Equivariances
============================

Symmetries
----------

Symmetries are important properties when dealing with scientific tasks, offering valuable insights into natural phenomena.

We may have heard of symmetries before. For example, a butterfly exhibits "mirror symmetry", meaning that a reflection across a mirror will keep it unchanged. Similarly the three blades of an electric fan exhibit "three-fold rotational symmetry", meaning it looks the same when rotated by 120 and 240 degrees. Additionally, we can say a perfect sphere to have "spherical symmetry", which means it will remain the same under any rotation and reflection. And of course, the gravatational field produced by such a sphere will also exhibit similar behavior under these transformations.

From the examples above, we may say that, "symmetry" is a set of transformations that keep some things or laws unchanged. 

This set is expected to have such properties:

- Combination: The combination of two transformations in the set will also be within the set, because the combination of two transformations that do not change the object will also leave it unchanged.

- Identity: There should be an identity transformation, which corresponds to doing nothing, since this of obviously  keep the object unchanged.

- Inverse: For every transformations in the set, there should be an iverse transformation such that combining the two results in the identity. This is because if a transformation leaves an object unchanged, the transformation from the end-state back to the start-state will also leave it unchanged, and combining the two will result in a transformation from start-state to start-state, that is, doing nothing.

In mathematics, we say this set of transformations forms a `group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)>`_. Though we will not go further into the details about groups, we will still use the term "symmetry groups" for the set of such transformations.

Below we give some examples of symmetry groups:
